Changelog unrepl

version 1.0.5  2022-08-14
-------------------------
Now raises a ValueError instead of IncorrectClipboardError if
the code is not proper REPL code.

The default for use_print_statements in unrepl is now True.

Resulting code now always ends with a linefeed.

version 1.0.4  2022-08-12
-------------------------
Code lines where the actual code starts with # are ignored now.

If you import with
    from unrepl import unrepl
the IncorrectClipboardError and __version__ were not reachable anymore.
Now the function unrepl supports these two variables as
    unrepl.IncorrectClipboardError
and
    unrepl.__version__
    
Tests added to the repository (in test_unrepl.py)l

version 1.0.3  2022-08-11
-------------------------
Lines that just start with >>> or ... without any content are now ignored completely

version 1.0.2  2022-08-10
-------------------------
The package is now also available on PyPI.


version 1.0.1  2022-08-09
-------------------------
When 'use_print_statements' is True, _ is calculated as well.
This also simplifies the print statement itself.
